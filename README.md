# pipi_photoproduction
Fortran routines for the computation of the pi+pi- photoproduction in S-, P, D- partial wave amplitudes and the Deck amplitude.

The Deck amplitude uses elastic pion proton partial wave amplitudes originally downloaded from the site of Data Analysis Center, Instutute of Nuclear Studies at George Washington University: https://gwdac.phys.gwu.edu/analysis/pin_analysis.html.
